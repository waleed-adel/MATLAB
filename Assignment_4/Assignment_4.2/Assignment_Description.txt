You will need the following hardware for this exercise:
	- Arduino.
	- Bread board.
	- potentiometer.
	- Connecting jumper wires.

Steps: 
	- Write a matlab code to specify a usb port for arduino and connect it with the laptop/pc.
	- Connect a potentiometer to a pin in arduino and begin reading the change in analog voltage.
	- Display the change in voltage on a graph. (check the video).
